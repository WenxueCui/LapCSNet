# LapCSNet-Pytorch

* Officical code of paper "An efficient deep convolutional laplacian pyramid architecture for CS reconstruction at low sampling ratios" ICASSP2018

## Requirements

* Windows10
* Matlab R2015b
* MatconvNet 1.0-beta23

## How to Run

### Training

* Preparing the training data. (T91 and BSDS200 are included in our repo)
* Train the LapCSNet, `train_LapCSN(0.1, 2, 0);`

### Testing

* Preparing the testing data. (Set5 and Set14 are included in our repo)
* Test the LapCSNet, `test_LapCSN_main(100, 200)`

## Experimental Results
